## Starting a cycle

To start a cycle, one member uses the `/start-cycle` command.

Example:

## Tracking your workout

To track a workout use the `/track` command. The track command requires a description of the evidence photo. After (or even before is fine) using the command, you post the evidence picture as usual. 

Example:

<img src="/home/alien/Pictures/Screenshot from 2021-11-27 20-01-06.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-11-27 20-01-06" style="zoom:67%;" />

<img src="/home/alien/Pictures/Screenshot from 2021-11-27 20-01-39.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-11-27 20-01-39" style="zoom:67%;" />

*Unfortunately Discord slash commands do not yet allow for attachments as an option type. This is why it isn't yet possible `/track` with images.*

 ## Setting an aim for the cycle (optional)

To set an aim for the current cycle use the `/set-aim` command.

Example:

<img src="/home/alien/Pictures/Screenshot from 2021-11-27 19-36-56.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-11-27 19-36-56" style="zoom: 67%;" />

<img src="/home/alien/Pictures/Screenshot from 2021-11-27 19-37-38.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-11-27 19-37-38" style="zoom:67%;" />

## End of cycle day of  reflection (optional)

Towards the end of the cycle, you can record a reflection on the cycle using the `/reflection` command. Note that you will not be able to add a reflection once the cycle is over.

Example:

## Your data

To get your data, use the `/get-data` command. A file will be sent to you in the public channel, but only you will be able to see it.
